# Coursera-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
This is the repository that contains my submission for the final project of the course Getting and Cleaning data (part of the Data Science Specialization) offered by Johns Hopkins University
, for the analysis on the provided dataset.

Dataset used:
Human Activity Recognition Dataset - UCI Har Dataset (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

Files in the repository:
I. CodeBook.md - Indicates all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.

II. run_analysis.R - performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course projectâ€™s instructions:

	i) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
	ii) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
	iii) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
	iv) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
	v) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
	
III. final_data.txt - This is the required Tidy data set obtained after all the abovementioned transformations.

IV. README.md - explains the analysis files.

Review Criteria:
  1. The submitted data set is tidy. 

  2. The Github repo contains the required scripts.

  3. GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.

  4. The README that explains the analysis files is clear and understandable.

  5. The work submitted for this project is the work of the student who submitted it.
